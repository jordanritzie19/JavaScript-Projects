These are some small projects I made using JavaScript.

## Projects

- [Pizza Menu](/Pizza_Project)
- [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](/TicTacToe)
- [Calculator](/Calculator)

### Pizza Menu
This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings. It then takes the input information to calculate the price for the order.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The classic game of tic-tac-toe. Take turns facing off in the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a computer. Sound feedback is given upon game completion depending on results, and a line is drawn marking how the game was won.

### Calculator
A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
